### General Assembly Data Science Immersive Capstone - Analysis of Bias in London Restaurant Reviews

As a half italian who grew up around restaurants I appreciate good hospitality and food. However, like most of us, I find that online ratings for restaurants cannot be taken at face value. This led me to explore bias in London restaurant ratings using data science.  

I was particularly keen to test my hypothesis that the location of a London restaurant influences the average score it receives. This knowledge could be useful for building more accurate restaurant recommendation engines.  

In this repository you can see the data Iâ€™ve considered so far which has been gathered from a number of sources (including web scraping with Selenium and Beautiful Soup), and how I wrangled, analysed and visualised it using Python (particularly the Pandas, MatplotLib and Seaborn libraries) and Tableau. 

I have used a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning and statistical techniques to both create new restaurant features and measure the influence of factors on general scoring tendencies:
- Clustering Algorithms - to search for a new feature to better represent location and density than the original features.
- Regression and Classification modelling - to measure and compare feature importances.
- Hypothesis testing - to analyse whether there is a statistically significant difference between review scores from zone 1 (London's central zone) compared to outer zones.

The key challenge in this project has been how to best represent and measure bias with available data. I've come at this from a number of angles, looking at both critic and user scores and more than one review website.  There are many further avenues to explore in the future.
