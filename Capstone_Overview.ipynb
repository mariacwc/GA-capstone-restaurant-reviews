    "There have been many capstone projects that predict restaurant ratings based on using details from individual reviews blended with information about the users providing reviews or details about the restaurant being reviewed.  These projects bring insights about factors that most contribute to the best or worst review scores and are useful to understand what makes a successful restaurant experience and build out recommendation engines.\n",

    "After looking at a number of different sources then the list of restaurants scraped from TimeOut website's front page was taken as the best list to use for this project, this was practical as:\n",
    "- the number of restaurants scraped was aligned with the number available from other sources once chain/fast food restaurants were removed;\n",
    "- the high level details provided by TimeOut in the individual restaurants' pages were helpful for creating features; \n",
    "- the TimeOut critic review was chosen as the best 'unbiased' baseline view of restaurants for rating comparison purposes from the initially available data; and\n",
    "- inconsistencies between restaurant metadata across data sources (e.g. different restaurant name and address syntax) meant taking a master list from another source to access TimeOut's features would have introduced complexities and potential unnecessary data loss.\n",

    "However, after initial analysis it became clear that not enough TimeOut users reviewed restaurants to have a large enough data set for modelling by relying on TimeOut reviews alone.  If a lower limit was set that at least 5 users had reviewed a restaurant to make its average rating meaningful, then only just over 500 restaurants were left.  Restaurant visitors use Google to rate a restaurant more frequently, using this overview data doubled the data set size for modelling to just over 1100.\n",
